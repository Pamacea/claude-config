## 🎯 Auto-Activation

**This skill auto-activates when:**
- Validating TrigMem implementation
- Checking classification accuracy
- Verifying storage decisions
- Auditing token efficiency

**Progressive Disclosure:**
1. **Metadata** → Validation checks
2. **Instructions** → Full verification process
3. **Resources** → Audit templates

## 🎯 TOKEN EFFICIENCY VERIFICATION

### Base Context Budget

**Target:** < 10k tokens

**Checklist:**
```markdown
☐ CLAUDE.md < 2k tokens?
☐ rules/ total < 8k tokens?
☐ Skills not loaded (0 tokens)?
☐ Total base < 10k tokens?
```

**Verification:**
```bash
# Count CLAUDE.md tokens (approximate)
wc -w ~/.claude/CLAUDE.md
# 1 word ≈ 1.3 tokens
# Should be < 1500 words (~2k tokens)

# Count rules tokens
wc -w ~/.claude/rules/*.md
# Total should be < 6000 words (~8k tokens)
```

---

### Progressive Disclosure Verification

**Checklist:**
```markdown
Skills Structure:
☐ Metadata section (quick reference)?
☐ Instructions section (full content)?
☐ Resources section (examples)?
☐ Clear sections with ## markers?
☐ Loads on-demand (not in base context)?
```

**Verification:**
```bash
# Check skill structure
grep -E "(## Metadata|## Instructions|## Resources)" ~/.claude/skills/*/SKILL.md
# Should exist in each skill

# Verify on-demand (not referenced in CLAUDE.md)
grep -r "skills/patterns" ~/.claude/CLAUDE.md
# Should only mention as reference, not load content
```

---

## 🔄 STORAGE DECISION VERIFICATION

### Decision Tree Test

**Scenario:** User asks "Where should I store X?"

**Verification Steps:**

1. **Identify information type**
   ```markdown
   ☐ Project identity? → Cat 1
   ☐ Structure/architecture? → Cat 2
   ☐ Reusable pattern? → Cat 4
   ☐ Workflow/operations? → Cat 5
   ☐ Correction/anti-pattern? → Cat 6
   ☐ Context-specific? → Don't store
   ```

2. **Verify storage location**
   ```markdown
   ☐ Correct location chosen?
   ☐ Not duplicated elsewhere?
   ☐ Appropriate format used?
   ☐ Token efficient?
   ```

3. **Test retrieval**
   ```markdown
   ☐ Easy to find?
   ☐ Clear category?
   ☐ Quick access?
   ☐ Properly labeled?
   ```

## 🧪 TEST CASES

### Test Case 1: Project Identity

**Input:** "What is this project?"

**Expected:**
```markdown
1. Find in CLAUDE.md
2. Return: Project name, stack, purpose
3. Token cost: ~1k
4. Time: Instant
```

**Verification:**
```bash
# Test: Read CLAUDE.md
cat ~/.claude/CLAUDE.md

# Should contain:
# - Project name
# - Stack
# - Purpose
# - < 100 lines
```

---

### Test Case 2: Pattern Loading

**Input:** "How do I implement Server Components?"

**Expected:**
```markdown
1. Recognize: Reusable pattern request
2. Load: /pattern nextjs
3. Find: Server Components section
4. Apply: User's project
5. Token cost: ~3k (skill only)
```

**Verification:**
```bash
# Test: Load skill
ls ~/.claude/skills/patterns/nextjs/SKILL.md

# Should exist and contain:
# - Server Components pattern
# - Code examples
# - Best practices
```

---

### Test Case 3: Decision Routing

**Input:** "Build payment system"

**Expected:**
```markdown
1. Recognize: Complex workflow
2. Decision: Spawn sub-agent
3. Task: "Implement Stripe payment"
4. Context: Provide project details
5. Token cost: Isolated context
```

**Verification:**
```bash
# Test: Decision framework
# Input: Complex task
# Expected: Sub-agent spawned
# Actual: Check implementation
```

## 💡 KEY INSIGHTS

### Verification Principles

1. **Categorization** → Correct storage
2. **Token Efficiency** → Minimal base context
3. **Progressive Disclosure** → On-demand loading
4. **No Duplication** → Single source of truth

### Common Issues

**Issue:** Bloated CLAUDE.md
**Fix:** Move details to skills/, keep CLAUDE.md minimal

**Issue:** Duplicated content
**Fix:** Single source of truth, reference elsewhere

**Issue:** High token cost
**Fix:** Progressive disclosure, on-demand skills

**Issue:** Poor categorization
**Fix:** Apply 6-category system consistently
